          <p>
            I peer through windows watch life go by. Dream of tomorrow and wonder why the past is holding me, keeping life at bay. I wander lost in yesterday,wanting to fly, but scared to try.
            </p>
             <p>
                But if someone like you,found someone like me.<br>
                 Then suddenly nothing would ever be the same. My heart would take wing and I'd feel so alive!<br>
                If someone like you found me.
